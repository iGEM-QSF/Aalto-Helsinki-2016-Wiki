				<h3>Finnish Environment Institute SYKE</h2>
				</br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">In order to gain more insight into how big problem cyanobacteria is in Finland we contacted the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. They guided us to the Finnish Environment Institute (Suomen ympäristökeskus, SYKE), where we got to discuss about the cyanobacteria problem and our project with some experts of the field.
				</p>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We talked to Jari Silander, Senior Research Scientist specializing in monitoring and cost-benefit analysis, and Juhani Kettunen, Program Director responsible for modernization of environmental monitoring activities. We introduced our project and briefly talked about synthetic biology. They found our approach interesting and promising since they have been trying to deal with the blue-green algae problem for many years now. It was also nice to hear that there is no available method at the moment to get rid of the cyanobacteria or the toxins, so there is actually need for our project.
				They described the full extent of algae detection problem in Finland and all the strategies used in past and at the moment to deal with it both in research and industry. </p>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">Thanks to them we found out about a very interesting project going on at the moment. There is an initiative funded by European Space Agency which facilitates high-resolution satellite imaging of lakes and seas and allows more accurate pinpointing of algal bloom locations. This led to the thought of modelling a distribution model of cyanobacterial blooms and improving SYKE’s AlgaeWatch (Levävahti)-app, with which one can see how cyanobacterial blooms are growing, with the imaging data that is freely available on SYKE’s website.
				They also discussed with us the business aspects of our project and gave us good advice on how to build our business strategy if we are to bring our algae detection and degradation methods to the masses. </p>
				</br>
				<h3>Meetings with companies</h3>
				</br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">As we were looking for funding and contacting different companies, we got a chance to visit a few and tell about our project. We talked with ThermoFisher and Algol which both showed great interest in our project and also decided to support us. Algol also posted about us and our project in their blog.
				</br>
				We had an incredible chance to spread the word among local biotechnology companies and organizations, such as Algol, ThermoFisher and LAL (Luonnontieteiden akateemisten liitto), and tell them about our project and talk in general about synthetic biology. They all showed great interest in our project and even agreed to support us in various ways. </p>
				<br></br>
				<h3>LUMA centre</h3>
			</br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We met some high school students who were candidates for the Finnish team of the International Biology Olympiad. Our team gave them a presentation about our project and synthetic biology. The students got to design their own little iGEM projects and hopefully learned DNA sequence engineering and what is possible with the tools of synthetic biology. They also asked questions about our studies and current majors and how one needs to prepare oneself to study them. Hopefully we were able to inspire them to continue with biology studies in the future. </p>

				<h1 id="THREE">Interviewing people on the streets of Helsinki</h1>
				<br></br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We decided to make a little survey/public outreach on the streets of Helsinki. 
				The goal was to find out about what people actually knew regarding cyanobacteria and synthetic biology as well as inform them about the same. We prepared a video of this interview and it can be viewed on our wiki page. As it turned out, raising awareness was really necessary – the term ‘synthetic biology’ wasn’t very familiar to people and was naturally associated with man-made biology.

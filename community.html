				<br></br>
                <h1 id="TWO">CollabSeeker</h1>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify"><br>From the very beginning when we started making our first efforts to collaborate with other teams we realized that there was very little information available publicly. Aalto-Helsinki 2015 iGEM team had already come up with and created a rough version of a search engine idea for collaboration which would allow teams of the year to find out about one another and their projects. We took up the work and built the CollabSeeker. While keeping a similar visual design we re-implemented the engine in Java and Spring frameworks, modified the HTML templates and added quite a few functionalities. 
                Using this tool one can easily find out what iGEM teams of the year are busy with. It contains detailed description of projects that teams have submitted on their wiki pages. Search results also give links to teams’ Facebook and Twitter accounts. In addition, each team already has an account created by us and can update them according to their collaboration needs.
                We are hoping that the whole iGEM community will embrace the CollabSeeker, and that in the years to come it will become a mundane part of the project that everyone will use in a similar manner as Aalto-Helsinki’s BioBrick and Team Seekers.</p>

				<h1 id="THREE">Collaboration with other iGEM teams</h1>
				</br>
                <p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We got to help in the starting of a new iGEM team, as we were approached by UCLouvain team from Belgium. It happened to be that one of their team members was on an exchange in the University of Helsinki, so we met and talked. We told as well as we could how our team was assembled the first time and what problems they had had. We talked about financing the project, choosing the project subject and about founding an organization to help with the financial side. Hopefully our tips were helpful and UCLouvain has had a great time in iGEM!</br></br>
                Thanks to the Stockholm conference we made good friends with other Nordic iGEM teams and got to do a small collaboration with the Uppsala team. They asked for general information and methods for working with yeast, since they knew from our NiC presentation that we were working with yeast. We had a Skype meeting with them and send our protocols.</br></br>
                EPF Lausanne team contacted us regarding a collaboration project they were planning to do which was a bit related to our CollabSeeker. We told about the CollabSeeker which they found very exciting. We ended up giving them an interview via Skype and got to know yet another great team.</br></br>
                We also got in touch with a few other teams. We shared information about ourselves and CollabSeeker for XMU-China team’s exchange platform – Newsletter; had skyped with TEC CEM team and learned about their team and project; and we also helped METU HS Ankara team to compile protocols in different languages by submitting our Finnish version.</p>

                <h3>Stockholm and Paris meetups</h3>
            </br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We participated in two iGEM meetups – Nordic iGEM Conference, or NiC, which was held in Stockholm, and The European Experience in Paris. They gave us a great opportunity to present our project, meet other iGEM teams, hear about their projects and collaborate.   
                At NiC, we got a chance to practice our project presentation skills as we took part in the Mini Jamboree, where we placed in the top 4! We also pondered with some ethical questions, and imagined what the world will look like in the future when everything is synbio in two great workshops the Stockholm team had organized. Our NiC experience was completed with traditional swedish table party Gasque and Sauna night.
                The Paris conference gave us a chance to prepare our first poster and take part in a heated poster session with more than twenty teams from all over Europe. There was an interesting panel discussion about biosecurity and the challenges and risks in synthetic biology. We also met with Randy Rettberg, the iGEM president.</p>

                <p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We participated in two iGEM meetups – the Nordic iGEM Conference, or NiC, which was held in Stockholm, and The European Experience in Paris. They gave us a great opportunity to present our project, meet other iGEM teams, hear about their projects and collaborate. We got to socialize with other iGEM teams, see their approaches in tackling problems regarding all aspects of the project (e.g. fundraising, wet lab, research, etc.). All teams seemed to have had similar difficulties and it was nice to know that we weren’t alone. We learned how iGEM projects are done in different countries. Last but not least we got acquainted with the culture of the country, did sightseeing, experienced Swedish Gasque and payed a visit to aunt Mona Lisa.</p><p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">At NiC, we got a chance to practice our project presentation skills as we took part in the Mini Jamboree. It was the first time we presented our project for an audience of that size. We placed in the top 4 and the winners got the honor of holding the NiC next year in their home-country. In two great ethics and arts workshops after the presentations we pondered some ethical questions, and imagined what the world would look like in the future where everything was based on synthetic biology. The judges, who were ex-iGEMers themselves, shared their experiences with us and about the current state of biotechnology in Sweden. The conference overall had a very warm setting and thanks to it we made some good friends. One of these friendships later led to a collaboration, which we will present below.</p><p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">The Paris conference gave us a chance to prepare our first poster and take part in a lively poster session with more than twenty teams from all over Europe. There was an interesting panel discussion about biosecurity and the challenges and risks in synthetic biology.</p><p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">These conferences also gave us a chance to meet iGEM officials – Vinoo Selvarajah and Randy Rettberg who gave us good advice which we will take into account in selecting next year’s Aalto-Helsinki team. This advice was to “Select your project and start as soon as possible so that you have enough time to get something done”.

                <p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We were lucky to have quite a few collaborations. We got to help in starting up a new iGEM team, as we were approached by UCLouvain team from Belgium. It happened to be that one of their team members was on an exchange in the University of Helsinki, so we met and talked. We told as well as we could how our team was assembled the first time and what problems they had had. We talked about financing the project, choosing the project subject and about founding an organization to help with the financial side. Hopefully our tips were helpful and UCLouvain has had a great time in iGEM!</p><p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">Thanks to the Stockholm conference we made good friends with the other Nordic iGEM teams and got to do a small collaboration with the Uppsala team. They asked for general information and methods for working with yeast, since they knew from our NiC presentation that we were working with yeast. We had a Skype meeting with them and sent our protocols.</p><p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">EPF Lausanne team contacted us regarding a collaboration project they were planning to do which was somewhat related to our CollabSeeker. They wanted to create a platform, in the form of a blog or website, on which they could present iGEM teams and projects through “news articles”.  We informed them about the CollabSeeker, which they found very exciting. We ended up giving them an interview via Skype, telling more about our search engine and answering questions to the survey they had prepared.</p><p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We also got in touch with a few other teams. We shared information about ourselves and CollabSeeker for XMU-China team’s exchange platform – Newsletter. </p><p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We had a Skype meeting with TEC CEM team and shared information about our teams as well as projects. The team, which is from Mexico, didn’t know that we had a true mexican in our team, and finding out about this was really fun.</p><p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We also helped METU HS Ankara team who wanted to create a database consisting of protocols in different language. We helped them to achieve their goal by translating our protocols into Finnish. Protocols were about Transformation, LB Broth, LB Agar, ONC, Competent Cell Preparation by Calcium Chloride, Getting the DNA Parts from the Kit Plate, Mini Prep Plasmid Isolation and Plasmid Isolation.</p></div>

                <p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">As this was the third year Aalto-Helsinki competed in iGEM, we decided that it was time to strengthen the continuity of the team and also provide basis for an Aalto-Helsinki community. This is why we founded an organization called Aalto-Helsinki Synthetic Biology ry, for all the members of the previous years’ and the present year’s teams. An organization would provide a great channel for communicating with the old teams and also helped a lot with handling our finances.</p><p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">As we were at the Nordic iGEM Conference, there was a lot of discussion of collaboration between different teams’ iGEM organizations. There was even ideas of a Nordic iGEM organization, which would function as a community for all the nordic iGEM organizations. However, as we had just founded the Aalto-Helsinki Synthetic Biology ry and wanted to get that running smoothly firs, in addition to having to focus on our iGEM project, nothing concrete was decided yet. The discussion of possible collaboration will probably start again after the Jamboree.</p></div>

				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify"><br>From the very beginning when we started making our first efforts to collaborate with other teams we realized that there was very little information available publicly. Aalto-Helsinki 2015 iGEM team had already come up with and created a rough version of a search engine idea for collaboration which would allow teams of the year to find out about one another and their projects. We took up the work and built the CollabSeeker. While keeping a similar visual design we re-implemented the engine in Java and Spring frameworks, modified the HTML templates and added quite a few functionalities. 
                Using this tool one can easily find out what iGEM teams of the year are busy with. It contains detailed description of projects that teams have submitted on their wiki pages. Search results also give links to teams’ Facebook and Twitter accounts. In addition, each team already has an account created by us and can update them according to their collaboration needs.
                We are hoping that the whole iGEM community will embrace the CollabSeeker, and that in the years to come it will become a mundane part of the project that everyone will use in a similar manner as Aalto-Helsinki’s BioBrick and Team Seekers.</p>

                <h1 id="FIVE">InterLab study</h1>
				</br>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				</br>
                <p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">In order to compare results of similar experiments from different sources iGEM has proposed Interlab studies. It’s a set of experiments that teams can volunteer to do in order to deal with relative results issue. The aim is to improve the tools available to both the iGEM community and the synthetic biology community as a whole.  This year’s goal was to let different teams measure fluorescence level of GFP protein.  With minor difficulties we managed to complete the experiments and submit our results.</p>
				</br></br>
				<h3>Overview</h3>
				</br>
                <p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">Work done in different labs can be hard to compare sometimes due to different measurement techniques or reporting methods. In order to address this issue iGEM has come up with Interlab studies which can be carried out by different teams around the world. Results of these studies are eventually combined to give understanding of relative issues arising during the process. 
				</p>
				</br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">One of the big challenges in synthetic biology is that measurements of fluorescence usually cannot be compared because they are reported in different units or because different groups process data in different ways.Often one works around this by doing some sort of “relative expression” comparison; however, being unable to directly compare measurements makes it harder to debug engineered biological constructs, harder to effectively share constructs between labs, and harder even to just interpret your experimental controls.
				</p>
				</br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">This year iGEM had two protocols for measuring GFP fluorescence that would result in common, comparable units for teams to test out.
				</p>
				<br></br>
				<h3>Results</h3>
				</br>
				<h4>Cell competency test</h4>
				</br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">Before using our competent cells in our experiment, we had to use the Competent Cell Test Kit<sup><a href="#a">[1]</a></sup> provided by iGEM to test the efficiency of our competent cells. The kit included five vials of purified DNA from BBa_J04450 in plasmid backbone pSB1C3. Each vial contained DNA at a different concentration: 50pg/&#181;l, 20pg/&#181;l, 10pg/&#181;l, 5pg/&#181;l, 0.5pg/&#181;. Transformations had to be performed  with each of these to determine how efficient our competent cells were.</p>
				</br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We used TOP10 <i>Escherichia coli</i> competent cells and SOC medium from the Gibson assembly kit that we ordered separately from New England Biolabs. On the first try we got around 10 colonies overall and clearly failed. Then we tried it again with one difference in the procedure - we added plasmids into the cells during the transformation, not the other way around which was written in the iGEM protocol. Unfortunately, it didn’t work the second time either and we got similar results. Not giving up, we tried it a third time and this time we additionally used pJR18 plasmid for positive control with three concentrations - 500 pg/&#181;l, 50 pg/&#181;l and 5 pg/&#181;l. Also for the antibiotic we used ampicillin instead of chloramphenicol and this time it finally worked. Although after counting the colonies it was revealed that transformation efficiency was quite low - 1.8E7 cfu/&#181;L on average and weighted 1.6E7 cfu/&#181;L it was good enough to proceed with the transformations and start the actual experiments. Our competency results can be found in table 1.</p>

				</br>
                
            
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">We accidentally put the LUDOX solution into -20 storage room so we had to order a new one. After it arrived we put it into wells with water according to the protocol<sup><a href="#b">[2]</a></sup> and measured it with a plate reader. After entering the numbers gotten from the plate reader into the excel sheet we got the final values - corrected Abs600, reference OD600 and correction factor (table 2).</p>
				</br>
                
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify"><i>2. Protocol FITC fluorescence standard curve</i></p>
				</br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">By following all the advice and procedures mentioned in the Calibration Protocol<sup><a href="#b">[2]</a></sup> we prepared 1xPBS, 2xFITC, incubated 2xFITC and prepared the 1xFITC solutions. Then having the solution, we did the serial dilutions according to the protocol and measured the fluorescence with a plate reader. After entering the numbers into the excel sheet we were able to calculate the standard curve of fluorescence for FITC concentration. Our results can be seen in figure 1.</p>

				</br>
				<h4>Cell measurement protocol</h4>
				</br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">Finally, after finishing all the calibrations, we did the transformations of five plasmids (three devices, positive and negative control). We succeeded only on our third time. The plasmids we received in the measurement kit<sup><a href="#c">[3]</a></sup> were dried out so we had to resuspend them in 100&#181;Ls of diH2O. Almost everything was done according to the transformation protocol<sup><a href="#d">[4]</a></sup>. Few differences were that after resuspending dried up DNA we were supposed to add 5&#181;L it but we added 10&#181;L. Then for the transformation of device 1 we did the heat shock for 70 seconds instead of 60. Also, we had to keep plates with colonies in the fridge for about three weeks due to some reasons. Therefore, we decided to do the restreaking of all colonies. Later these new colonies were used for cell cultures.</p>
				</br>
				<p style="font-size:19px" class="justify">After growing of cell cultures was done we measured their OD600. Later, after diluting the cultures to a target OD600 of 0.02 and completing other necessary procedures we measured the hourly recording. Results can be found in figures 2 and 3.</p>

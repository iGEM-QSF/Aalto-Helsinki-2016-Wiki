				</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There has been lots of challenges during the project, but I getting to tackle those challenges has been the best part of iGEM by far - in the future, I definitely want to keep pushing myself and not settle for the easiest route if there’s another option that allows me to keep learning new, interesting things!</p>

				<h3>Jami Valorinta<br>
				<small><i>Mathematics at the University of Helsinki</i></small></h3>
				<p class="lead" style="text-align: justify">In the team I’ve mostly been doing everything related to computers. In the beginning of the summer, I updated our website at aaltohelsinki.com. Then a lot of time went into the server-side programming of the CollabSeeker. After that, I was responsible for coding WikiFire+ for the wiki team, while also helping out with the front-end development. As a math major, I was also pretty deeply involved with the modelling and computer simulations. And I was even let into the lab a few times! It was nice to try my hand at plating and other common lab procedures.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Spring 2016. I saw a poster in the hallway of Kumpula, the natural sciences campus of the University of Helsinki. It was advertising a synthetic biology competition I had never heard about. At the time I didn’t have a very clear idea what synthetic biology even was, but the poster was calling for mathematicians with programming experience, and I was looking for something challenging to do during the summer, so I decided to apply to this “iGEM”.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the summer, I’ve solidified my programming skills, learned the process of mathematical modelling from the ground up, tried my hand at lab work, and gotten a little taste of real research work. That’s not to even mention the indoor surfing, wall climbing, room escaping and other fun stuff we did during the summer. This has definitely been a formative experience.</p>

			<p class="lead" style="text-align: justify">We would like to start with thanking <b>Markus Linder</b>, the primary PI of our project. He has been there for us right from the start, introducing us to the ways of iGEM and guiding us through the brainstorming and initial research stages. He helped us get in touch with experts and also arranged for some of our funding. We held weekly meetings with him almost during the whole project and got valuable advice on many matters. During different stages of the project we had several ideas on which direction to proceed in - he helped us recognize the more important things to focus on. He has also encouraged independent thinking amongst ourselves to maintain the student-driven aspect of the project. Lately, he has helped us a lot in preparing for the Giant Jamboree. His support has been invaluable in our iGEM journey.

			<p class="lead" style="text-align: justify"><b>Heli Viskari</b> was our instructor and also there for us from the beginning. She answered all questions related to the lab and also arranged the lab space for us - so important for carrying out for our experiments! She helped with the FACS instrument and setup. She also regularly gave her input on our results and the progress of our project. </p>
			</br>
			<p class="lead" style="text-align: justify"><b>Merja Penttilä</b> (VTT) encouraged us to think outside the box in our brainstorming sessions. As the secondary PI of our project, she gave us advice and direction when designing our project idea.</p>
			</br>
			<p class="lead" style="text-align: justify">We had the opportunity to talk to <b>Kaarina Sivonen</b> and her cyanobacteria research group at the University of Helsinki. They really helped us by answering our questions, providing us with the cyanobacteria we used in our experiments and by analysing our enzyme activity samples. We were in contact especially with <b>David Fewer</b>, who is a researcher at the group. He helped us in planning the project and provided useful research articles. With his input we were able to design and carry out various laboratory experiments. Also, the group’s laboratory technician, <b>Matti Wahlsten</b>, helped us tremendously and we are very grateful to him for analysing all of our enzyme activity samples (there was a lot of them). He also gave us the safety training concerning working with the toxins and the cyanobacteria and how to handle and dispose of them. Without Matti’s help, we would have had to come up with some different way of analysing the enzyme activity in our samples, which most likely would have given us less time to spend on doing other things in the lab. As a gesture of thanks we decided to name the main character in our introduction video as Matti.</p>

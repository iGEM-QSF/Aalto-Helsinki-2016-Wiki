<p class="justify" style="font-size:19px;">Our plan was to use baker's yeast, <i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>, to detect the oxidative stress caused by the cyanobacterial toxin microcystin. We successfully created a sensor that produces yellow fluorescent protein in response to such stress. Our best candidate for this sensor device is constituted of two parts: the mitochondrial cytochrome-c peroxidase (CCP1) promoter, and the Venus yellow fluorescent protein coding sequence, fused together.
</p></br>
<p class="justify" style="font-size:19px;">As the yeast strain we used for our experiments is unable to import microcystin itself without modifications, we validated our proof of concept by subjecting yeast containing this sensor device to oxidative stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide.
</p></br>
<p class="justify" style="font-size:19px;">We measured the fluorescence produced by different concentrations of stress-inducing hydrogen peroxide by growing our yeast in a microplate reader and measuring the development of yellow fluorescence and cell density over time. We performed this measurement with three technical replicates, and the mean values of fluorescence over time are presented in figure 2.
</p></br>
FIGURE
<p class="justify" style="font-size:19px;">From figure 1, it can be seen that higher hydrogen peroxide concentrations produce a higher fluorescent response. The base level of uninduced fluorescence remains low. As hydrogen peroxide affects cell growth negatively, an additional graph was plotted of fluorescence as a function of cell density (figure 2). This helps remove the bias of changing cell density.
</p></br>
FIGURE

<p class="justify" style="font-size:19px;">Figure 2 maintains the relationship of increasing induction concentrations and increasing fluorescence values. To further verify this data, and remove possible biases of cell density and other background factors, fluorescence of stress-induced cell cultures was also measured with flow cytometry. Venus YFP under the GPD1 promoter was used as a control to assess possible background biases that hydrogen peroxide concentration causes to fluorescence values. The results are presented in figure 3, along with the measurement results for another stress promoter, TSA1.
</p></br>
PICTURE
<p class="justify" style="font-size:19px;">As seen in figure 3, the absolute fluorescence values seem to increase with hydrogen peroxide induction also in the control (GPD1 promoter). This could be due to the fact that because hydrogen peroxide slows culture growth, a relatively bigger portion of the cells in the culture are older, meaning that they have have accumulated more fluorescence. Because a defined number of cells are measured to obtain the fluorescence distribution, slower culture growth can show up as this kind of a bias. To account for this, fluorescence values were divided by the respective uninduced values of each promoter (figure 4).
</p></br>
PICTUER
<p class="justify" style="font-size:19px;">In figure 4, it is clearly evident that the CCP1 promoter is strongly induced to produce more fluorescence when subjected to oxidative stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide; the relative changes in the control GPD1 promoter are much smaller. The fact that the CCP1 promoter does not seem to have the previously observed linear relation between fluorescence and induction concentration can be due to inaccuracies in the measurements, as multiple replicates of the measurement were not performed. As the absolute fluorescence values were not very big, they are also more easily affected by various inaccuracies.
</p></br>
<p class="justify" style="font-size:19px;">As we have obtained proof in multiple measurements across multiple replicates of the CCP1 promoter being induced by oxidative stress in the form of hydrogen peroxide, we can conclude that we have formed a solid proof of concept for this part of our project.
